# Resume

If you're looking for my resume, then try going to [johnschrom.com/resume/resume.pdf](https://johnschrom.com/resume/resume.pdf). You can also find my CV at [johnschrom.com/resume/cv.pdf](https://johnschrom.com/resume/cv.pdf).

My resume is written in LaTeX, compiled using GitHub actions, and hosted on GitHub pages. That's what's in this repo. It is based off [rover resume](https://github.com/subidit/rover-resume).
